Hi ðŸ‘‹,My name is AImuel Emmanuel

<hr>

I've been coding since my college days, started off with visual basic, c++ and java and python.I progressively moved to product design where I learnt the basics of web design. Having an eye for the core functionalities of the user interface and not just the design itself, I proceeded to learning HTML,CSS,JavaScript and ReactJs where i am now focused on building a career as a software frontend engineer.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with React JS, Tailwind CSS, and using them to build fun, creative Web Projects

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more of Reactjs.

- âš¡ Asides coding , i enjoy frequent visits to the gym and i also love playing football.
