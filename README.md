Hi ðŸ‘‹,My name is AImuel Emmanuel

I've been coding since my college days, started off with visual basic, c++ and java and during my internship term, i took a beginners course in "Introduction to programming using Python.I progressively moved to product design where I learnt the basics of web design. Having an eye for the core functionalities of the user interface and not just the design itself, I proceeded to learning HTML,CSS,JavaScript and ReactJs where i am now focused on building a career as a software frontend engineer.


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about ReactJs
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m open to collaborate on interesting projects
- âš¡  Asides coding, I enjoy regular visits to the gym and i enjoy playing soccer.
